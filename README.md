# CV-2022

This is an old CV layout I made a few years ago while learning HTML and CSS.  
The design uses a simple two-column layout with a green theme.

I updated the UI recently to clean up the spacing, fix some alignment issues, and make the colors more consistent, but the project still stays close to the original beginner version.

### Built with
- HTML

### Why this exists
I like keeping some of my older beginner work to see how much I’ve improved over time.

Nothing advanced here, just early practice.
